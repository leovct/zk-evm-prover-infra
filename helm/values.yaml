worker:
  # The Docker image for the worker.

  # Enable or disable the HPA worker autoscaler.
  # If disabled, the number of workers deployed will be set according to `minWorkerCount`.

  # The minimum number of worker pods to maintain.
  # The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) will not scale down below this value.

  resources:
    # Resource requests are used by the Kubernetes scheduler to decide which node to place the pod on.
    # requests:
    #   # We set the memory request to 300M so that we can have at least 4 workers on a node with 1.4T memory.

    # Resource limits are enforced by the Kubernetes kubelet to prevent containers from using more resources than specified.

# RabbitMQ Configuration
