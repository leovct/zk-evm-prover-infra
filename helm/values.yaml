# Type 1 Prover Configuration
worker:
  # The Docker image for the worker.
  image: leovct/paladin-worker:latest

  # The minimum number of worker pods to maintain.
  # The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) will not scale down below this value.
  minWorkerCount: 1

  # The maximum number of worker pods to scale up to.
  # We start with 2 nodes, so we limit the maximum workers to 8 (4 per node).
  maxWorkerCount: 8

  resources:
    # Resource requests are used by the Kubernetes scheduler to decide which node to place the pod on.
    requests:
      # We set the memory request to 300Mi so that we can have at least 4 workers on a node with 1.4Ti memory.

    # Resource limits are enforced by the Kubernetes kubelet to prevent containers from using more resources than specified.
    limits:
      # We set the memory limit to 1Ti. A worker should not need more memory than this under normal circumstances.

# RabbitMQ Configuration

# Jumpbox Configuration
